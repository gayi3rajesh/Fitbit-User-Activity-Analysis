# Personal Fitness Tracker Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes personal fitness data collected from 35 Fitbit users, including daily activity, steps, and distance. The goal is to identify trends and patterns in users' habits related to physical activity and fitness, using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Google Sheets**: Managed raw data and served as a platform for initial data exploration and organization.
- **SQL**: Used for querying and processing data stored in Google BigQuery.
- **R**: Utilized for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of personal fitness tracker data for 35 Fitbit users, including the following key features:
- **Date**: Date of the recorded activity.
- **Steps**: Total steps taken during the day.
- **Activity Level**: Intensity of activity (e.g., low, moderate, high).
- **Calories Burned**: Total calories burned during the day.

## Key Insights and Analysis

- **Activity Patterns**: Identified patterns in user activity levels, such as peak hours for walking and exercise.
- **Steps and calories burnt**: Analyzed the relationship between calories and the number of steps taken, providing insights into fitness levels.
- **Visualization**: Created dynamic charts to display trends over Calories Burned by Activity Level
